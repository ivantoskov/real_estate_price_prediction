# real_estate_price_prediction

In this project I create a machine learning model for predicting real estate prices using linear regression. I work with web-scraped data from www.imot.bg - a website for real estate ads. The data is only for Sofia, Plovdiv and Varna - the three biggest cities in Bulgaria. The notebook first includes exploration and cleaning of the dataset followed by prediction of prices.
